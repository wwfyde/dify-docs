# Overview

Web applications are for application consumers. When an application developer creates an application in MoLook, he will get a corresponding web application. Users of the web application can use it without logging in. The web application is adapted to different sizes of devices: PC, tablet and mobile.

The content of the web application is consistent with the configuration published by the application. When the configuration of the application is modified and the "Publish" button is clicked on the prompt word layout page of the application to publish, the content of the web application will also be updated according to the configuration of the current application.

We can enable and disable access to the web application on the application overview page, and modify the site information of the web application:

* Icon
* Name
* Application Description
* Interface Language
* Copyright Information
* Privacy Policy Link

The functional performance of the web application depends on whether the developer enables this function when compiling the application, for example:

* Conversation remarks
* Variables filled in before the conversation
* Follow-up
* Speech to text
* More answers like this (Text Generation apps)
* ...

In the following chapters, we will introduce the two types of web applications separately:

* Text Generator
* Conversational
